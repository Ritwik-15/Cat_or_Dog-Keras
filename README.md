# Cat_or_Dog-Keras
In this project we will be identifying if the given image is a cat or a dog using DL, CNN, Python and Keras.
It uses image processing and Convolution Neural Networks to detect and identify the image.

## Prerequsites
* Python 3
* Keras

## Accessable From
``CNN.py``
#### _**The images of the single prediction can be changed fron the dataset or form the #single pred section in the code**_

## Steps to success
1. Preprocessing the images using Keras
2. Making the random dataset for training the model
3. Making the CNN
4. Training it with the dataset created.
5.Predicting the input image provided by us using the trained model.
